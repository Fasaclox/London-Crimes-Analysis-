# London-Crimes-Analysis-
### Project Overview:

The project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about crimes that occurred in London from 2021 to 2023. The dataset categorizes individuals into five major roles: Accomplice, Informant, Witness, Victim, and Offender. The primary goal of the analysis is to derive insights into the prevalent crimes, understand crime demographics, explore correlations between different crime roles, evaluate crime resolution rates, and delve into the resolution of specific crimes.

### Goals:

1. **Identify Top Prevalent Crimes:** Analyze the dataset to determine the most prevalent crimes occurring in London during the specified period.

2. **Crime Demographics:** Explore demographic patterns related to crimes, considering factors such as location, time, and other relevant variables.

3. **Correlation Between Crime Roles:** Investigate if there is any correlation between the various roles in crimes (Accomplice, Informant, Witness, Victim, and Offender).

4. **Crime Resolution Rate:** Evaluate the overall rate at which crimes are resolved within the dataset.

5. **Crime Resolution by Type:** Examine how different types of crimes contribute to the overall resolution rate.

### Specific Focus:

The specific focus of the project is on understanding the dynamics of crime in London, with an emphasis on the roles of individuals involved. This involves analyzing the prevalence of different crimes, exploring patterns in demographics, and assessing the relationships between various crime roles.

### Tools:

The project will utilize the following tools for data analysis, visualization, and presentation:

1. **Microsoft Excel:** Employed for data cleaning, manipulation, and initial analysis.

2. **Microsoft Power BI:** Utilized for in-depth data visualization, generating interactive reports, and extracting insights.

3. **Microsoft PowerPoint:** Used for presenting the findings and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, facilitating effective communication with stakeholders.

These tools collectively enable a comprehensive analysis of crime data, providing insights that can inform strategies for law enforcement and community safety.
